# MajoraAtaxx
A board game for Global Game Jam 2026

Majora's Ataxx: The 24 Masks

Majora's Ataxx is a thematic reimagining of the classic strategy board game Ataxx, heavily inspired by the dark and mystical world of The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask. Players engage in a tactical "curse" of territory control, attempting to spread their influence across the 7x7 grid while battling against the impending "Dawn of a New Day."

🎭 Thematic Features

The 24 Masks of Termina

The game features a fully customizable avatar system where both players can choose from the complete collection of 24 masks found in the original game.

Transformation Masks: Deku, Goron, Zora, and Fierce Deity.

Quest Masks: Mask of Truth, Bunny Hood, Keaton Mask, Garo's Mask, and more.

Antagonist Pieces: Command the board as Majora's Mask or even the Moon itself.

Aesthetic & Sound

Clock Town Interface: The UI utilizes a premium "Wood & Gold" aesthetic reminiscent of the Clock Tower and the Bomber's Notebook.

Dynamic Background: A deep purple "Termite" sky with subtle radial gradients sets a mysterious tone.

Retro Audio Engine: Custom synthesized sound effects for movements (glides), captures (noise bursts), and victories (The Song of Healing-inspired arpeggios).

🕹️ Gameplay Mechanics

Movement Rules

Players take turns moving their chosen masks across the board:

Clone (1 space): Moving to an adjacent tile creates a new mask, increasing your total count.

Jump (2 spaces): Moving two tiles away teleports the piece, leaving the original tile empty.

Infection: Landing next to an opponent's mask "curses" it, instantly converting all adjacent enemy pieces into your own mask.

Strategic Tools

19 Classic Level Maps: Choose from a variety of layouts including "The Gauntlet," "Gridlock," and "The Maze," or generate a "Random Curse" for unique symmetric obstacles.

Song of Time (Undo): Mistaken moves can be reversed using the undo feature, mimicking the flow of time.

Song of Time Tempo (AI Difficulty): A sliding scale (1-100) that dictates the AI's tactical intelligence and reaction time.

🛠️ Technical Specifications

Single-File Architecture: Built entirely in a portable HTML/CSS/JS file.

Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop mouse clicks and mobile touch interactions with a "no-zoom" viewport lock.

Smart AI: Employs a score-based heuristic engine to simulate challenging gameplay in "vs AI" mode.

Local Multiplayer: Supports "Local 2P" mode for head-to-head battles on a single device.

In this game, the moon is always descending. Can you conquer the board before the final chime?
